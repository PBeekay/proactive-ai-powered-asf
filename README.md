üõ°Ô∏è Real-Time AI Anti-Spam System üõ°Ô∏è
A multi-service, server-side application designed to detect and filter spam, phishing, and malicious content in real-time using a microservices architecture, a live threat intelligence database, and a powerful Large Language Model (LLM).

‚ú® Core Features
This system provides a robust defense against malicious content by combining multiple layers of analysis:

LLM-Powered Content Analysis: Utilizes the Google Gemini API for deep contextual understanding of text to identify sophisticated phishing attempts and scams that keyword-based systems would miss.

Live Reputation Database: Leverages Redis for a high-speed, dynamic blocklist of malicious domains, IPs, and keywords.

Proactive Threat Intelligence: A dedicated background service continuously fetches data from public threat intelligence feeds, ensuring the reputation database is always up-to-date with emerging threats.

Resilient & Scalable Architecture: Built on a microservices model using RabbitMQ, ensuring that components are decoupled and can be scaled independently.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The application follows a message-driven microservices pattern, ensuring high throughput and resilience.

[Incoming Content]--->[Ingestion API]--->[Queue]--->[Combined Intelligence Worker]

üõ†Ô∏è Components
Ingestion API (main.py): A lightweight FastAPI server that acts as the public-facing entry point. It validates incoming data and places it onto the RabbitMQ queue for processing.

Combined Intelligence Worker (worker.py): The core of the system. This worker consumes messages from the queue and performs a multi-layered analysis, combining evidence from the live Redis blocklist and the Gemini API to make a final, accurate verdict.

Threat Intel Worker (threat_intel_worker.py): A proactive background service that runs independently. It periodically fetches data from external threat intelligence feeds and updates the Redis reputation database.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the full system running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Docker

A Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/realtime-ai-spam-filter.git
cd realtime-ai-spam-filter

Create a requirements.txt file in your project folder with the following content:

fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
pika
redis
requests

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Add your Gemini API Key:
Open the worker.py file and paste your API key into the apiKey variable:

# worker.py
apiKey = "PASTE_YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

Running the System
You will need three separate terminals open in your project directory to run the full system.

Start Backend Services (RabbitMQ & Redis):
In one of your terminals, run the Docker commands to start the message queue and the database:

# Start RabbitMQ
docker run -d --name project2-rabbit -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management

# Start Redis
docker run -d --name project3-redis -p 6379:6379 redis

Run the Threat Intelligence Worker:
In your first terminal, start the threat intel script. Let it run for a minute to populate the database.

python threat_intel_worker.py

Run the Combined Intelligence Worker:
In your second terminal, start the main AI worker. It will connect to RabbitMQ and Redis.

python worker.py

Run the API Server:
In your third terminal, start the FastAPI server.

uvicorn main:app --reload

Your full anti-spam system is now running! You can send test messages to the API endpoint (http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze) via the interactive docs and monitor the analysis in your worker terminals.
